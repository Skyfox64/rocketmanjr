Simple Angular + Flask + MongoDB Application with some CRUD operations

First things first.

I looked into installing all the latest tooling to build an Angular + Python application. I updated my version of Node which happened to update Python to v3.9.6 and install the ever-useful Chocolatey.

I spent some time looking into some technologies I want to use.

- The last version of Angular I touched was 7, and so I wanted to get the latest, which is 12.

- I wanted to use a NoSQL database because, in general, they make for quick prototyping and standing up of projects. Lately I have been using SQLite and MySQL databases and am wanting to try something new. I have never actually used MongoDB, but I have extensively used Microsoft Azure's NoSQL offering -- CosmoDB.

- For the backend language, Python is my preferred as I have never written code in Node.js. Also, I was thinking this would be a good chance to set-up a small project using Flask, of which I have heard is very quick and easy.

And with any new problem I face, I generally start off by getting a better idea of what it is I am getting myself into. Thus, I went off in search of resources on the internet for "Angular CLI", "Flask", "MongoDB" in some combination. I did happen to find this https://github.com/reddimohan/angular-flask-mongodb which seems to be dated around ~2019 and it was using Angular v8. I went ahead and just started from scratch with an out of the box app from the latest version of Angular CLI (v12).
